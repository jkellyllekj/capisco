# Quick Refresh Guide

When the Assistant gets sluggish or unresponsive, just copy and paste ONE of these lines into the chat:

## Level 1 (Try this first):
Run refresh.sh to clear temporary files and processes

## Level 2 (If Level 1 doesn't help):
Run nuclear-reset.sh to restart the VM

That's it! The Assistant will execute the commands for you automatically.

## Project Summary (Paste this after a refresh)

This is an Italian language learning website built from class transcripts. Each section includes vocabulary, audio, info buttons, and quizzes. The goal is to make a reusable template for any transcript, with spaced repetition and user progress tracking. Right now, we’re enhancing the Almercato page and fixing quiz issues. Please review the current files and continue from here.

## What these do:
- **refresh.sh**: Kills hanging processes, clears temp files, frees up memory
- **nuclear-reset.sh**: Complete VM restart (more aggressive, always works)

## Pro tip:
After running nuclear-reset.sh, start a new chat session for best results. Then paste the Project Summary above to help the Assistant quickly get up to speed.
