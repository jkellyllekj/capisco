# Quick Refresh Guide

When the Assistant gets sluggish or unresponsive, just copy and paste ONE of these lines into the chat:

## Level 1 (Try this first):
```
Run refresh.sh to clear temporary files and processes
```

## Level 2 (If Level 1 doesn't help):
```
Run nuclear-reset.sh to restart the VM
```

That's it! The Assistant will execute the commands for you automatically.

## What these do:
- **refresh.sh**: Kills hanging processes, clears temp files, frees up memory
- **nuclear-reset.sh**: Complete VM restart (more aggressive, always works)

## Pro tip:
After running nuclear-reset.sh, start a fresh chat session for best results.
