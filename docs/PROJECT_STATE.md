## PAUSE IN ACTION LOG

### 2026-01-07, Phase 16A Stabilisation and Image Validation

- Sentence cards validated as first class renderer inputs
- Local, owned images validated as canonical assets
- Image prompts tested and proven effective
- Renderer remains schema agnostic
- Context saturation detected and handled via Pause In Action
- Repo prepared for clean handoff and new chat

### 2026-01-08, Phase 16A Image Handling Notes, No Further Changes

- Confirmed the desired behavior is full images, not cut offs
- Confirmed that portrait dominance on smaller viewports is acceptable for now
- Decision: do not add portrait specific layout hacks
- Action: revert demo layout tweak and keep responsive behavior as it was
- Captured image creation guidance for later phases, landscape primary plus portrait secondary, same subject

### 2026-01-08, Phase 16A Sentence Overview Pass

- Renderer updated so sentence cards do not look bland compared to vocab cards
- Overview for sentence cards now surfaces examples and notes, plural row hidden
- Tag pills for sentence cards mapped from sentence fields, level and lemmaId and first tag
- Demo validated in 2 up mode with mixed card types

Repo state remains safe to commit and push.
