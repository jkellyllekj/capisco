# Retrospective Decision Candidates

Purpose: temporary holding area for behaviours, constraints, or assumptions that appear to be guiding the project but are not yet captured as formal decisions.

Rules:
- This file is non-authoritative.
- Entries are observations, not decisions.
- Items are promoted deliberately to DECISIONS.md, WORKING_METHOD.md, or PROJECT_STATE.md — or deleted.
- Keep this file small. Clear it regularly.

Status: Phase 8 active.
